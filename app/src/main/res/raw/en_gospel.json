        "text": "In the beginning was the Word: and the Word was with God and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. Through him all things came to be, not one thing had its being but through him. All that came to be had life in him and that life was the light of men, a light that shines in the dark, a light that darkness could not overpower[*a]. A man came, sent by God. His name was John. He came as a witness, as a witness to speak for the light, so that everyone might believe through him. He was not the light, only a witness to speak for the light. The Word was the true light that enlightens all men; and he was coming into the world. He was in the world that had its being through him, and the world did not know him. He came to his own domain and his own people did not accept him. But to all who did accept him he gave power to become children of God, to all who believe in the name of him who was born not out of human stock or urge of the flesh or will of man but of God himself. The Word was made flesh, he lived among us[*b], and we saw his glory, the glory that is his as the only Son of the Father, full of grace and truth. John appears as his witness. He proclaims: ‘This is the one of whom I said: He who comes after me ranks before me because he existed before me’. Indeed, from his fulness we have, all of us, received – yes, grace in return for grace, since, though the Law was given through Moses, grace and truth have come through Jesus Christ. No one has ever seen God; it is the only Son, who is nearest to the Father’s heart, who has made him known."

        "text": "This is how John appeared as a witness. When the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, ‘Who are you?’  he not only declared, but he declared quite openly, ‘I am not the Christ’.  ‘Well then,’ they asked ‘are you Elijah?' ‘I am not’ he said. ‘Are you the Prophet?' He answered, ‘No’.  So they said to him, ‘Who are you? We must take back an answer to those who sent us. What have you to say about yourself?’  So John said, ‘I am, as Isaiah prophesied: a voice that cries in the wilderness: Make a straight way for the Lord’.  Now these men had been sent by the Pharisees,  and they put this further question to him, ‘Why are you baptising if you are not the Christ, and not Elijah, and not the prophet?’  John replied, ‘I baptise with water; but there stands among you – unknown to you –  the one who is coming after me; and I am not fit to undo his sandal-strap’.  This happened at Bethany, on the far side of the Jordan, where John was baptising.  The next day, seeing Jesus coming towards him, John said, ‘Look, there is the lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world.  This is the one I spoke of when I said: A man is coming after me who ranks before me because he existed before me.  I did not know him myself, and yet it was to reveal him to Israel that I came baptising with water.’  John also declared, ‘I saw the Spirit coming down on him from heaven like a dove and resting on him.  I did not know him myself, but he who sent me to baptise with water had said to me, “The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and rest is the one who is going to baptise with the Holy Spirit”.  Yes, I have seen and I am the witness that he is the Chosen One of God.’"

        "text": "On the following day as John stood there again with two of his disciples,  Jesus passed, and John stared hard at him and said, ‘Look, there is the lamb of God’.  Hearing this, the two disciples followed Jesus.  Jesus turned round, saw them following and said, ‘What do you want?’ They answered, ‘Rabbi,’ – which means Teacher -‘where do you live?’  ‘Come and see’ he replied; so they went and saw where he lived, and stayed with him the rest of that day. It was about the tenth hour.  One of these two who became followers of Jesus after hearing what John had said was Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter.  Early next morning, Andrew met his brother and said to him, ‘We have found the Messiah’ – which means the Christ –  and he took Simon to Jesus. Jesus looked hard at him and said, ‘You are Simon son of John; you are to be called Cephas’ – meaning Rock.  The next day, after Jesus had decided to leave for Galilee, he met Philip and said, ‘Follow me’.  Philip came from the same town, Bethsaida, as Andrew and Peter.  Philip found Nathanael and said to him, ‘We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, the one about whom the prophets wrote: he is Jesus son of Joseph, from Nazareth’.  ‘From Nazareth?’ said Nathanael ‘Can anything good come from that place?’ ‘Come and see’ replied Philip.  When Jesus saw Nathanael coming he said of him, ‘There is an Israelite who deserves the name, incapable of deceit’.  ‘How do you know me?’ said Nathanael ‘Before Philip came to call you,’ said Jesus ‘I saw you under the fig tree.’  Nathanael answered, ‘Rabbi, you are the Son of God, you are the King of Israel’.  Jesus replied, ‘You believe that just because I said: I saw you under the fig tree. so You will see greater things than that.’  And then he added ‘I tell you most solemnly, you will see heaven laid open and, above the Son of Man, the angels of God ascending and descending’."

When they ran out of wine, since the wine provided for the wedding was all finished, the mother of Jesus said to him, ‘They have no wine’.  Jesus said ‘Woman, why turn to me? My hour has not come yet.’  His mother said to the servants, ‘Do whatever he tells you'.  There were six stone water jars standing there, meant for the ablutions that are customary among the Jews: each could hold twenty or thirty gallons.  Jesus said to the servants, ‘Fill the jars with water’, and they filled them to the brim.  ‘Draw some out now’ he told them ‘and take it to the steward.’  They did this; the steward tasted the water, and it had turned into wine. Having no idea where it came from – only the servants who had drawn the water knew – the steward called the bridegroom  and said; ‘People generally serve the best wine first, and keep the cheaper sort till the guests have had plenty to drink; but you have kept the best wine till now’.  This was the first of the signs given by Jesus: it was given at Cana in Galilee. He let his glory be seen, and his disciples believed in him.  After this he went down to Capernaum with his mother and the brothers, but they stayed there only a few days."

Making a whip out of some cord, he drove them all out of the Temple, cattle and sheep as well, scattered the money changers’ coins, knocked their tables over  and said to the pigeon-sellers, ‘Take all this out of here and stop turning my Father’s house into a market’.  Then his disciples remembered the words of scripture: Zeal for your house will devour me.  The Jews intervened and said, ‘What sign can you show us to justify what you have done?’  Jesus answered, ‘Destroy this sanctuary, and in three days I will raise it up’.  The Jews replied, ‘It has taken forty-six years to build this sanctuary: are you going to raise it up in three days?’  But he was speaking of the sanctuary that was his body,  and when Jesus rose from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and they believed the scripture and the words he had said.  During his stay in Jerusalem for the Passover many believed in his name when they saw the signs that he gave,  but Jesus knew them all and did not trust himself to them;  he never needed evidence about any man; he could tell what a man had in him."

Jesus answered: ‘I tell you most solemnly, unless a man is born from above, he cannot see the kingdom of God’.  Nicodemus said, ‘How can a grown man be born? Can he go back into his mother’s womb and be born again?’  Jesus replied: ‘I tell you most solemnly, unless a man is born through water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God:  what is born of the flesh is flesh; what is born of the Spirit is spirit.  Do not be surprised when I say: You must be born from above.  The wind blows wherever it pleases; you hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. That is how it is with all who are born of the Spirit.’  ‘How can that be possible?’ asked Nicodemus.  ‘You, a teacher in Israel, and you do not know these things!’ replied Jesus.  ‘I tell you most solemnly, we speak only about what we know and witness only to what we have seen and yet you people reject our evidence.  If you do not believe me when I speak about things in this world, how are you going to believe me when I speak to you about heavenly things?  No one has gone up to heaven except the one who came down from heaven, the Son of Man who is in heaven; and the Son of Man must be lifted up  as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert,  so that everyone who believes may have eternal life in him.  Yes, God loved the world so much that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not be lost but may have eternal life.  For God sent his Son into the world not to condemn the world, but so that through him the world might be saved.  No one who believes in him will be condemned; but whoever refuses to believe is condemned already, because he has refused to believe in the name of God’s only Son.  On these grounds is sentence pronounced: that though the light has come into the world men have shown they prefer darkness to the light because their deeds were evil.  And indeed, everybody who does wrong hates the light and avoids it, for fear his actions should be exposed;  but the man who lives by the truth comes out into the light, so that it may be plainly seen that what he does is done in God;’"

At the same time John was baptising at Aenon near Salim, where there was plenty of water, and people were going there to be baptised.  This was before John had been put in prison.  Now some of John’s disciples had opened a discussion with a Jew about purification,  so they went to John and said, ‘Rabbi, the man who was with you on the far side of the Jordan, the man to whom you bore witness, is baptising now; and everyone is going to him’.  John replied: ‘A man can lay claim only to what is given him from heaven.  ‘You yourselves can bear me out: I said: I myself am not the Christ; I am the one who has been sent in front of him.  ‘The bride is only for the bridegroom; and yet the bridegroom’s friend, who stands there and listens, is glad when he hears the bridegroom’s voice. This same joy I feel, and now it is complete.  He must grow greater, I must grow smaller.  He who comes from above is above all others; he who is born of the earth is earthly himself and speaks in an earthly way. He who comes from heaven  bears witness to the things he has seen and heard, even if his testimony is not accepted;  though all who do accept his testimony are attesting the truthfulness of God,  since he whom God has sent speaks God’s own words: God gives him the Spirit without reserve.  The Father loves the Son and has entrusted everything to him.  Anyone who believes in the Son has eternal life, but anyone who refuses to believe in the Son will never see life: the anger of God stays on him.’"

        "text": "When Jesus heard that the Pharisees had found out that he was making and baptising more disciples than John –  though in fact it was his disciples who baptised, not Jesus himself –  he left Judaea and went back to Galilee.  This meant that he had to cross Samaria.  On the way he came to the Samaritan town called Sychar, near the land that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.  Jacob’s well is there and Jesus, tired by the journey, sat straight down by the well. It was about the sixth hour.  When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, ‘Give me a drink’.  His disciples had gone into the town to buy food.  The Samaritan woman said to him, ‘What? You are a Jew and you ask me, a Samaritan, for a drink?’ – Jews, in fact, do not associate with Samaritans.  Jesus replied: ‘If you only knew what God is offering and who it is that is saying to you: Give me a drink, you would have been the one to ask, and he would have given you living water’.  ‘You have no bucket, sir,’ she answered ‘and the well is deep: how could you get this living water?  Are you a greater man than our father Jacob who gave us this well and drank from it himself with his sons and his cattle?’  Jesus replied: ‘Whoever drinks this water will get thirsty again;  but anyone who drinks the water that I shall give will never be thirsty again: the water that I shall give will turn into a spring inside him, welling up to eternal life’.  ‘Sir,’ said the woman ‘give me some of that water, so that I may never get thirsty and never have to come here again to draw water.’  ‘Go and call your husband’ said Jesus to her ‘and come back here.’  The woman answered, ‘I have no husband’. He said to her, ‘You are right to say, “I have no husband”;  for although you have had five, the one you have now is not your husband. You spoke the truth there.’  ‘I see you are a prophet, sir’ said the woman.  ‘Our fathers worshipped on this mountain, while you say that Jerusalem is the place where one ought to worship.’  Jesus said: ‘Believe me, woman, the hour is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.  You worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know: for salvation comes from the Jews.  But the hour will come – in fact it is here already – when true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth: that is the kind of worshipper the Father wants.  God is spirit, and those who worship must worship in spirit and truth.’  The woman said to him, ‘I know that Messiah – that is, Christ – is coming; and when he comes he will tell us everything’.  ‘I who am speaking to you,’ said Jesus ‘I am he.’  At this point his disciples returned, and were surprised to find him speaking to a woman, though none of them asked, ‘What do you want from her?’ or, ‘Why are you talking to her?’  The woman put down her water jar and hurried back to the town to tell the people.  ‘Come and see a man who has told me everything I ever did; I wonder if he is the Christ?’  This brought people out of the town and they started walking towards him.  Meanwhile, the disciples were urging him, ‘Rabbi, do have something to eat;  but he said, ‘I have food to eat that you do not know about’.  So the disciples asked one another, ‘Has someone been bringing him food?’  But Jesus said: ‘My food is to do the will of the one who sent me, and to complete his work.  Have you not got a saying: Four months and then the harvest? Well, I tell you: Look around you, look at the fields; already they are white, ready for harvest! Already  the reaper is being paid his wages, already he is bringing in the grain for eternal life, and thus sower and reaper rejoice together.  For here the proverb holds good: one sows, another reaps;  I sent you to reap a harvest you had not worked for. Others worked for it; and you have come into the rewards of their trouble.’  Many Samaritans of that town had believed in him on the strength of the woman’s testimony when she said, ‘He told me all I have ever done’,  so, when the Samaritans came up to him, they begged him to stay with them. He stayed for two days, and  when he spoke to them many more came to believe;  and they said to the woman, ‘Now we no longer believe because of what you told us; we have heard him ourselves and we know that he really is the saviour of the world’."

He himself had declared that there is no respect for a prophet in his own country,  but on his arrival the Galileans received him well, having seen all that he had done at Jerusalem during the festival which they too had attended.  He went again to Cana in Galilee, where he had changed the water into wine. Now there was a court official there whose son was ill at Capernaum  and, hearing that Jesus had arrived in Galilee from Judaea, he went and asked him to come and cure his son as he was at the point of death.  Jesus said, ‘So you will not believe unless you see signs and portents!’  ‘Sir,’ answered the official ‘come down before my child dies.’  ‘Go home,’ said Jesus ‘your son will live.’ The man believed what Jesus had said and started on his way;  and while he was still on the journey back his servants met him with the news that his boy was alive.  He asked them when the boy had begun to recover. ‘The fever left him yesterday’ they said ‘at the seventh hour.’  The father realised that this was exactly the time when Jesus had said, ‘Your son will live’; and he and all his household believed.  This was the second sign given by Jesus, on his return from Judaea to Galilee."

        "text": "Some time after this there was a Jewish festival, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.  Now at the Sheep Pool in Jerusalem there is a building, called Bethzatha in Hebrew, consisting of five porticos;  and under these were crowds of sick people – blind, lame, paralysed – waiting for the water to move;  for at intervals the angel of the Lord came down into the pool, and the water was disturbed, and the first person to enter the water after this disturbance was cured of any ailment he suffered from.  One man there had an illness which had lasted thirty-eight years,  and when Jesus saw him lying there and knew he had been in this condition for a long time, he said, ‘Do you want to be well again?’  ‘Sir,’ replied the sick man ‘I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is disturbed; and while I am still on the way, someone else gets there before me.’  Jesus said, ‘Get up, pick up your sleeping-mat and walk’.  The man was cured at once, and he picked up his mat and walked away. Now that day happened to be the sabbath,  so the Jews said to the man who had been cured, ‘It is the sabbath; you are not allowed to carry your sleeping-mat’.  He replied, ‘But the man who cured me told me, “Pick up your mat and walk”‘.  They asked, ‘Who is the man who said to you, “Pick up your mat and walk”?’  The man had no idea who it was, since Jesus had disappeared into the crowd that filled the place.  After a while Jesus met him in the Temple and said, ‘Now you are well again, be sure not to sin any more, or something worse may happen to you’.  The man went back and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had cured him.  It was because he did things like this on the sabbath that the Jews began to persecute Jesus.  His answer to them was, ‘My Father goes on working, and so do I’.  But that only made the Jews even more intent on killing him, because, not content with breaking the sabbath, he spoke of God as his own Father, and so made himself God’s equal.  To this accusation Jesus replied: ‘I tell you most solemnly, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he sees the Father doing: and whatever the Father does the Son does too.  For the Father loves the Son and shows him everything he does himself, and he will show him even greater things than these, works that will astonish you.  Thus, as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so the Son gives life to anyone he chooses;  for the Father judges no one; he has entrusted all judgement to the Son,  so that all may honour the Son as they honour the Father. Whoever refuses honour to the Son refuses honour to the Father who sent him.  I tell you most solemnly, whoever listens to my words, and believes in the one who sent me, has eternal life; without being brought to judgement he has passed from death to life.  I tell you most solemnly, the hour will come – in fact it is here already – when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and all who hear it will live.  For the Father, who is the source of life, has made the Son the source of life;  and, because he is the Son of Man, has appointed him supreme judge.  Do not be surprised at this, for the hour is coming when the dead will leave their graves at the sound of his voice:  those who did good will rise again to life; and those who did evil, to condemnation.  I can do nothing by myself; I can only judge as I am told to judge, and my judging is just, because my aim is to do not my own will, but the will of him who sent me.  ‘Were I to testify on my own behalf, my testimony would not be valid;  but there is another witness who can speak on my behalf, and I know that his testimony is valid.  You sent messengers to John, and he gave his testimony to the truth:  not that I depend on human testimony; no, it is for your salvation that I speak of this.  John was a lamp alight and shining and for a time you were content to enjoy the light that he gave.  But my testimony is greater than John’s: the works my Father has given me to carry out, these same works of mine testify that the Father has sent me.  Besides, the Father who sent me bears witness to me himself. You have never heard his voice, you have never seen his shape,  and his word finds no home in you because you do not believe in the one he has sent.  ‘You study the scriptures, believing that in them you have eternal life; now these same scriptures testify to me,  and yet you refuse to come to me for life!  As for human approval, this means nothing to me.  Besides, I know you too well: you have no love of God in you.  I have come in the name of my Father and you refuse to accept me; if someone else comes in his own name you will accept him.  How can you believe, since you look to one another for approval and are not concerned with the approval that comes from the one God?  Do not imagine that I am going to accuse you before the Father: you place your hopes on Moses, and Moses will be your accuser.  If you really believed him you would believe me too, since it was I that he was writing about;  but if you refuse to believe what he wrote, how can you believe what I say?’"

Jesus climbed the hillside, and sat down there with his disciples.  It was shortly before the Jewish feast of Passover.  Looking up, Jesus saw the crowds approaching and said to Philip, ‘Where can we buy some bread for these people to eat?’  He only said this to test Philip; he himself knew exactly what he was going to do.  Philip answered, ‘Two hundred denarii would only buy enough to give them a small piece each’.  One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, said,  ‘There is a small boy here with five barley loaves and two fish; but what is that between so many?’  Jesus said to them, ‘Make the people sit down’. There was plenty of grass there, and as many as five thousand men sat down.  Then Jesus took the loaves, gave thanks, and gave them out to all who were sitting ready; he then did the same with the fish, giving out as much as was wanted.  When they had eaten enough he said to the disciples, ‘Pick up the pieces left over, so that nothing gets wasted’.  So they picked them up, and filled twelve hampers with scraps left over from the meal of five barley loaves.  The people, seeing this sign that he had given, said, ‘This really is the prophet who is to come into the world’.  Jesus, who could see they were about to come and take him by force and make him king, escaped back to the hills by himself."

Other boats, however, had put in from Tiberias, near the place where the bread had been eaten.  When the people saw that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into those boats and crossed to Capernaum to look for Jesus.  When they found him on the other side, they said to him, ‘Rabbi, when did you come here?’  Jesus answered: ‘I tell you most solemnly, you are not looking for me because you have seen the signs but because you had all the bread you wanted to eat.  Do not work for food that cannot last, but work for food that endures to eternal life, the kind of food the Son of Man is offering you, for on him the Father, God himself, has set his seal.’  Then they said to him, ‘What must we do if we are to do the works that God wants?’  Jesus gave them this answer, ‘This is working for God: you must believe in the one he has sent’.  So they said, ‘What Sign will you give to show us that we should believe in you? What work will you do?  Our fathers had manna to eat in the desert; as scripture says: He gave them bread from heaven to eat'.  Jesus answered: ‘I tell you most solemnly, it was not Moses who gave you bread from heaven, it is my Father who gives you the bread from heaven, the true bread;  for the bread of God is that which comes down from heaven and gives life to the world’.  ‘Sir,’ they said ‘give us that bread always.’  Jesus answered: ‘I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will never be hungry; he who believes in me will never thirst.  But, as I have told you, you can see me and still you do not believe.  All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I shall not turn him away;  because I have come from heaven, not to do my own will, but to do the will of the one who sent me.  Now the will of him who sent me is that I should lose nothing of all that he has given to me, and that I should raise it up on the last day.  Yes, it is my Father’s will that whoever sees the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and that I shall raise him up on the last day.’  Meanwhile the Jews were complaining to each other about him, because he had said, ‘I am the bread that came down from heaven’.  ‘Surely this is Jesus son of Joseph’ they said. ‘We know his father and mother. How can he now say, “I have come down from heaven”?’  Jesus said in reply, ‘Stop complaining to each other.  ‘No one can come to me unless he is drawn by the Father who sent me, and I will raise him up at the last day.  It is written in the prophets: They will all be taught by God, and to hear the teaching of the Father, and learn from it, is to come to me.  Not that anybody has seen the Father, except the one who comes from God: he has seen the Father.  I tell you most solemnly, everybody who believes has eternal life.  I am the bread of life.  Your fathers ate the manna in the desert and they are dead;  but this is the bread that comes down from heaven, so that a man may eat it and not die.  I am the living bread which has come down from heaven. Anyone who eats this bread will live for ever; and the bread that I shall give is my flesh, for the life of the world.’  Then the Jews started arguing with one another: ‘How can this man give us his flesh to eat?’ they said.  Jesus replied: I tell you most solemnly, if you do not eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you will not have life in you.  Anyone who does eat my flesh and drink my blood has eternal life, and I shall raise him up on the last day.  For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink.  He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood lives in me and I live in him.  As I, who am sent by the living Father, myself draw life from the Father, so whoever eats me will draw life from me.  This is the bread come down from heaven; not like the bread our ancestors ate: they are dead, but anyone who eats this bread will live for ever.’  He taught this doctrine at Capernaum, in the synagogue.  After hearing it, many of his followers said, ‘This is intolerable language. How could anyone accept it?’  Jesus was aware that his followers were complaining about it and said, ‘Does this upset you?  What if you should see the Son of Man ascend to where he was before?  ‘It is the spirit that gives life, the flesh has nothing to offer. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and they are life.  ‘But there are some of you who do not believe.’ For Jesus knew from the outset those who did not believe, and who it was that would betray him.  He went on, ‘This is why I told you that no one could come to me unless the Father allows him’.  After this, many of his disciples left him and stopped going with him."

As the Jewish feast of Tabernacles drew near,  his brothers said to him, ‘Why not leave this place and go to Judaea, and let your disciples see the works you are doing;  if a man wants to be known he does not do things in secret; since you are doing all this, you should let the whole world see’.  Not even his brothers, in fact, had faith in him.  Jesus answered, ‘The right time for me has not come yet, but any time is the right time for you.  The world cannot hate you, but it does hate me, because I give evidence that its ways are evil.  Go up to the festival yourselves: I am not going to this festival, because for me the time is not ripe yet.’  Having said that, he stayed behind in Galilee.  However, after his brothers had left for the festival, he went up as well, but quite privately, without drawing attention to himself.  At the festival the Jews were on the look-out for him: ‘Where is he?’ they said.  People stood in groups whispering about him. Some said, ‘He is a good man’; others, ‘No, he is leading the people astray’.  Yet no one spoke about him openly, for fear of the Jews.  When the festival was half over, Jesus went to the Temple and began to teach.  The Jews were astonished and said, ‘How did he learn to read? He has not been taught.’  Jesus answered them: ‘My teaching is not from myself: it comes from the one who sent me;  and if anyone is prepared to do his will, he will know whether my teaching is from God or whether my doctrine is my own.  When a man’s doctrine is his own he is hoping to get honour for himself; but when he is working for the honour of one who sent him, then he is sincere and by no means an impostor.  Did not Moses give you the Law? And yet not one of you keeps the Law! ‘Why do you want to kill me?’  The crowd replied, ‘You are mad! Who wants to kill you?’  Jesus answered, ‘One work I did, and you are all surprised by it.  Moses ordered you to practise circumcision – not that it began with him, it goes back to the patriarchs – and you circumcise on the sabbath.  Now if a man can be circumcised on the sabbath so that the Law of Moses is not broken, why are you angry with me for making a man whole and complete on a sabbath?  Do not keep judging according to appearances; let your judgement be according to what is right.’"

They answered, ‘We are descended from Abraham and we have never been the slaves of anyone; what do you mean, “You will be made free”?’  Jesus replied: ‘I tell you most solemnly, everyone who commits sin is a slave.  Now the slave’s place in the house is not assured, but the son’s place is assured.  So if the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed.  I know that you are descended from Abraham; but in spite of that you want to kill me because nothing I say has penetrated into you.  What I; for my part, speak of is what I have seen with my Father; but you, you put into action the lessons learnt from your father.’  They repeated, ‘Our father is Abraham’. Jesus said to them: ‘If you were Abraham’s children, you would do as Abraham did.  As it is, you want to kill me when I tell you the truth as I have learnt it from God; that is not what Abraham did.  What you are doing is what your father does.’ ‘We were not born of prostitution,' they went on ‘we have one father: God.’  Jesus answered: ‘If God were your father, you would love me, since I have come here from God; yes, I have come from him; not that I came because I chose, no, I was sent, and by him.  Do you know why you cannot take in what I say? It is because you are unable to understand my language.  The devil is your father, and you prefer to do what your father wants. He was a murderer from the start; he was never grounded in the truth; there is no truth in him at all: when he lies he is drawing on his own store, because he is a liar, and the father of lies.  But as for me, I speak the truth and for that very reason, you do not believe me.  Can one of you convict me of sin? If I speak the truth, why do you not believe me?  A child of God listens to the words of God; if you refuse to listen, it is because you are not God’s children.’  The Jews replied, ‘Are we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and possessed by a devil?’ Jesus answered:  ‘I am not possessed; no, I honour my Father, but you want to dishonour me.  Not that I care for my own glory, there is someone who takes care of that and is the judge of it.  I tell you most solemnly, whoever keeps my word will never see death.’  The Jews said, ‘Now we know for certain that you are possessed. Abraham is dead, and the prophets are dead, and yet you say, “Whoever keeps my word will never know the taste of death”.  Are you greater than our father Abraham, who is dead? The prophets are dead too. Who are you claiming to be?’  Jesus answered: ‘If I were to seek my own glory that would be no glory at all; my glory is. conferred by the Father, by the one of whom you say, “He is our God”  although you do not know him. But I know him, and if I were to say: I do not know him, I should be a liar, as you are liars yourselves. But I do know him, and I faithfully keep his word.  Your father Abraham rejoiced to think that he would see my Day; he saw it and was glad.’  The Jews then said, ‘You are not fifty yet, and you have seen Abraham!’  Jesus replied: ‘I tell you most solemnly, before Abraham ever was, I Am’.  At this they picked up stones to throw at him; but Jesus hid himself and left the Temple."

        "text": "As he went along, he saw a man who had been blind from birth.  His disciples asked him, ‘Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, for him to have been born blind?’  ‘Neither he nor his parents sinned,’ Jesus answered ‘he was born blind so that the works of God might be displayed in him.  ‘As long as the day lasts I must carry out the work of the one who sent me; the night will soon be here when no one can work.  As long as I am in the world I am the light of the world.’  Having said this, he spat on the ground, made a paste with the spittle, put this over the eyes of the blind man.  and said to him, ‘Go and wash in the Pool of Siloam (a name that means ‘sent’). So the blind man went off and washed himself, and came away with his sight restored.  His neighbours and people who earlier had seen him begging said, ‘Isn’t this the man who used to sit and beg?’  Some said, ‘Yes, it is the same one’. Others said, ‘No, he only looks like him’. The man himself said, ‘I am the man’.  So they said to him, ‘Then how do your eyes come to be open?’  ‘The man called Jesus’ he answered ‘made a paste, daubed my eyes with it and said to me, “Go and wash at Siloam”; so I went, and when I washed I could see.’  They asked, ‘Where is he?’ ‘I don’t know’ he answered.  They brought the man who had been blind to the Pharisees.  It had been a sabbath day when Jesus made the paste and opened the man’s eyes,  so when the Pharisees asked him how he had come to see, he said, ‘He put a paste on my eyes, and I washed, and I can see’.  Then some of the Pharisees said, ‘This man cannot be from God: he does not keep the sabbath’. Others said, ‘How could a sinner produce signs like this?’ And there was disagreement among them.  So they spoke to the blind man again, ‘What have you to say about him yourself, now that he has opened your eyes?’ ‘He is a prophet’ replied the man.  However, the Jews would not believe that the man had been blind and had gained his sight, without first sending for his parents and  asking them, ‘Is this man really your son who you say was born blind? If so, how is it that he is now able to see?’  His parents answered, ‘We know he is our son and we know he was born blind,  but we don’t know how it is that he can see now, or who opened his eyes. He is old enough: let him speak for himself.’  His parents spoke like this out of fear of the Jews, who had already agreed to expel from the synagogue anyone who should acknowledge Jesus as the Christ.  This was why his parents said, ‘He is old enough; ask him’.  So the Jews again sent for the man and said to him, ‘Give glory to God! For our part, we know that this man is a sinner.’  The man answered, ‘I don’t know if he is a sinner; I only know that I was blind and now I can see’.  They said to him, ‘What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?’  He replied, ‘I have told you once and you wouldn’t listen. Why do you want to hear it all again? Do you want to become his disciples too?’  At this they hurled abuse at him: ‘You can be his disciple,’ they said ‘we are disciples of Moses:  we know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this man, we don’t know where he comes from’.  The man replied, ‘Now here is an astonishing thing! He has opened my eyes, and you don’t know where he comes from!  We know that God doesn’t listen to sinners, but God does listen to men who are devout and do his will.  Ever since the world began it is unheard of for anyone to open the eyes of a man who was born blind;  if this man were not from God, he couldn’t do a thing.’  ‘Are you trying to teach us,’ they replied ‘and you a sinner through and through, since you were born!’ And they drove him away.  Jesus heard they had driven him away, and when he found him he said to him, ‘Do you believe in the Son of Man?’  ‘Sir,’ the man replied ‘tell me who he is so that I may believe in him.’  Jesus said, ‘You are looking at him; he is speaking to you’.  The man said, ‘Lord, I believe’, and worshipped him.  Jesus said: ‘It is for judgement that I have come into this world, so that those without sight may see and those with sight turn blind’.  Hearing this, some Pharisees who were present said to him, ‘We are not blind, surely?’  Jesus replied: ‘Blind? If you were, you would not be guilty, but since you say, “We see”, your guilt remains."

When he has brought out his flock, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow because they know his voice.  They never follow a stranger but run away from him: they do not recognise the voice of strangers.’  Jesus told them this parable but they failed to understand what he meant by telling it to them.  So Jesus spoke to them again: ‘I tell you most solemnly, I am the gate of the sheepfold.  All others who have come are thieves and brigands; but the sheep took no notice of them  I am the gate. Anyone who enters through me will be safe: he will go freely in and out and be sure of finding pasture.  The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I have come so that they may have life and have it to the full.  I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd is one who lays down his life for his sheep.  The hired man, since he is not the shepherd and the sheep do not belong to him, abandons the sheep and runs away as soon as he sees a wolf coming, and then the wolf attacks and scatters the sheep;  this is because he is only a hired man and has no concern for the sheep.  I am the good shepherd; I know my own and my own know me,  just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for my sheep.  And there are other sheep I have that are not of this fold, and these I have to lead as well. They too will listen to my voice, and there will be only one flock, and one shepherd.  The Father loves me, because I lay down my life in order to take it up again.  No one takes it from me; I lay it down of my own free will, and as it is in my power to lay it down, so it is in my power to take it up again; and this is the command I have been given by my Father.’  These words caused disagreement among the Jews.  Many said, ‘He is possessed, he is raving; why bother to listen to him?’  Others said, ‘These are not the words of a man possessed by a devil: could a devil open the eyes of the blind?’"

The works I do in my Father’s name are my witness;  but you do not believe, because you are no sheep of mine.  The sheep that belong to me listen to my voice; I know them and they follow me.  I give them eternal life; they will never be lost and no one will ever steal them from me.  The Father who gave them to me is greater than anyone, and no one can steal from the Father.

So the Law uses the word gods of those to whom the word of God was addressed, and scripture cannot be rejected.  Yet you say to someone the Father has consecrated and sent into the world, “You are blaspheming”, because he says, “I am the son of God”.  If I am not doing my Father’s work, there is no need to believe me;  but if I am doing it, then even if you refuse to believe in me, at least believe in the work I do; then you will know for sure that the Father is in me and I am in the Father.’  They wanted to arrest him then, but he eluded them."

The sisters sent this message to Jesus, ‘Lord, the man you love is ill’.  On receiving the message, Jesus said, ‘This sickness will end not in death but in God’s glory, and through it the Son of God will be glorified’.  Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus,  yet when he heard that Lazarus was ill he stayed where he was for two more days  before saying to the disciples, ‘Let us go to Judaea’.  The disciples said, ‘Rabbi, it is not long since the Jews wanted to stone you; are you going back again?’  Jesus replied: ‘Are there not twelve hours in the day? A man can walk in the daytime without stumbling because he has the light of this world to see by;  but if he walks at night he stumbles, because there is no light to guide him.’  He said that and then added, ‘Our friend Lazarus is resting, I am going to wake him’.  The disciples said to him, ‘Lord, if he is able to rest he is sure to get better’.  The phrase Jesus used referred to the death of Lazarus, but they thought that by ‘rest’ he meant ‘sleep’, so  Jesus put it plainly, ‘Lazarus is dead;  and for your sake I am glad I was not there because now you will believe. But let us go to him.’  Then Thomas – known as the Twin – said to the other disciples, ‘Let us go too, and die with him’.  On arriving, Jesus found that Lazarus had been in the tomb for four days already.  Bethany is only about two miles from Jerusalem,  and many Jews had come to Martha and Mary to sympathise with them over their brother.  When Martha heard that Jesus had come she went to meet him. Mary remained sitting in the house.  Martha said to Jesus, ‘If you had been here, my brother would not have died,  but I know that, even now, whatever you ask of God, he will grant you’.  ‘Your brother’ said Jesus to her ‘will rise again.’  Martha said, ‘1 know he will rise again at the resurrection on the last day’.  Jesus said: ‘I am the resurrection. If anyone believes in me, even though he dies he will live,  and whoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?’  ‘Yes, Lord,’ she said ‘I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, the one who was to come into this world.’  When she had said this, she went and called her sister Mary, saying in a low voice, ‘The Master is here and wants to see you’.  Hearing this, Mary got up quickly and went to him.  Jesus had not yet come into the village; he was still at the place where Martha had met him.  When the Jews who were in the house sympathising with Mary saw her get up so quickly and go out, they followed her, thinking that she was going to the tomb to weep there.  Mary went to Jesus, and as soon as she saw him she threw herself at his feet, saying, ‘Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died’.  At the sight of her tears, and those of the Jews who followed her, Jesus said in great distress, with a sigh that came straight from the heart,  ‘Where have you put him?’ They said, ‘Lord, come and see’.  Jesus wept;  and the Jews said, ‘See how much he loved him!’  But there were some who remarked, ‘He opened the eyes of the blind man, could he not have prevented this man’s death?’  Still sighing, Jesus reached the tomb: it was a cave with a stone to close the opening.  Jesus said, ‘Take the stone away’. Martha said to him, ‘Lord, by now he will smell; this is the fourth day’.  Jesus replied, ‘Have I not told you that if you believe you will see the glory of God?’  So they took away the stone. Then Jesus lifted up his eyes and said: ‘Father, I thank you for hearing my prayer.  I knew indeed that you always hear me, but I speak for the sake of all these who stand round me, so that they may believe it was you who sent me.’  When he had said this, he cried in a loud voice, ‘Lazarus, here! Come out!’  The dead man came out, his feet and hands bound with bands of stuff and a cloth round his face. Jesus said to them, ‘Unbind him, let him go free’."

Then the chief priests and Pharisees called a meeting. ‘Here is this man working all these signs’ they said ‘and what action are we taking?  If we let him go on in this way everybody will believe in him, and the Romans will come and destroy the Holy Place and our nation.’  One of them, Caiaphas, the high priest that year, said, ‘You don’t seem to have grasped the situation at all;  you fail to see that it is better for one man to die for the people, than for the whole nation to be destroyed’.  He did not speak in his own person, it was as high priest that he made this prophecy that Jesus was to die for the nation –  and not for the nation only, but to gather together in unity the scattered children of God.  From that day they were determined to kill him.  So Jesus no longer went about openly among the Jews, but left the district for a town called Ephraim, in the country bordering on the desert, and stayed there with his disciples."

They gave a dinner for him there; Martha waited on them and Lazarus was among those at table.  Mary brought in a pound of very costly ointment, pure nard, and with it anointed the feet of Jesus, wiping them with her hair; the house was full of the scent of the ointment.  Then Judas Iscariot – one of his disciples, the man who was to betray him – said,  ‘Why wasn’t this ointment sold for three hundred denarii, and the money given to the poor?’  He said this, not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief; he was in charge of the common fund and used to help himself to the contributions.  So Jesus said, ‘Leave her alone; she had to keep this scent for the day of my burial.  You have the poor with you always, you will not always have me.’  Meanwhile a large number of Jews heard that he was there and came not only on account of Jesus but also to see Lazarus whom he had raised from the dead.  Then the chief priests decided to kill Lazarus as well,  since it was on his account that many of the Jews were leaving them and believing in Jesus."

Jesus found a young donkey and mounted it – as scripture says:  Do not be afraid, daughter of Zion; see, your king is coming, mounted on the colt of a donkey.  At the time his disciples did not understand this, but later, after Jesus had been glorified, they remembered that this had been written about him and that this was in fact how they had received him.  All who had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead were telling how they had witnessed it;  it was because of this, too, that the crowd came out to meet him: they had heard that he had given this sign.  Then the Pharisees said to one another, ‘You see, there is nothing you can do; look, the whole world is running after him!’"

These approached Philip, who came from Bethsaida in Galilee, and put this request to him, ‘Sir, we should like to see Jesus’.  Philip went to tell Andrew, and Andrew and Philip together went to tell Jesus.  Jesus replied to them: ‘Now the hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.  I tell you, most solemnly, unless a wheat grain falls on the ground and dies, it remains only a single grain; but if it dies, it yields a rich harvest.  Anyone who loves his life loses it; anyone who hates his life in this world will keep it for the eternal life.  If a man serves me, he must follow me, wherever I am, my servant will be there too. If anyone serves me, my Father will honour him.  Now my soul is troubled. What shall I say: Father, save me from this hour? But it was for this very reason that I have come to this hour.  Father, glorify your name!’ A voice came from heaven, ‘I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.’  People standing by, who heard this, said it was a clap of thunder; others said, ‘It was an angel speaking to him’.  Jesus answered, ‘It was not for my sake that this voice came, but for yours.  ‘Now sentence is being passed on this world; now the prince of this world is to be overthrown.  And when I am lifted up from the earth, I shall draw all men to myself.’  By these words he indicated the kind of death he would die.  The crowd answered, ‘The Law has taught us that the Christ will remain for ever. How can you say, “The Son of Man must be lifted up”? Who is this Son of Man?’  Jesus then said: ‘The light will be with you only a little longer now. Walk while you have the light, or the dark will overtake you; he who walks in the dark does not know where he is going.  While you still have the light, believe in the light and you will become sons of light.’ Having said this, Jesus left them and kept himself hidden."

Indeed, they were unable to believe because, as Isaiah says again:  He has blinded their eyes, he has hardened their heart, for fear they should see with their eyes and understand with their heart, and turn to me for healing.  Isaiah said this when saw his glory, and his words referred to Jesus.  And yet there were many who did believe in him, even among the leading men, but they did not admit it, through fear of the Pharisees and fear of being expelled from the synagogue:  they put honour from men before the honour that comes from God.  Jesus declared publicly: ‘Whoever believes in me believes not in me but in the one who sent me,  and whoever sees me, sees the one who sent me.  I, the light, have come into the world, so that whoever believes in me need not stay in the dark any more.  If anyone hears my words and does not keep them faithfully, it is not I who shall condemn him, since I have come not to condemn the world, but to save the world:  he who rejects me and refuses my words has his judge already: the word itself that I have spoken will be his judge on the last day.  For what I have spoken does not come from myself; no, what I was to say, what I had to speak, was commanded by the Father who sent me,  and I know that his commands mean eternal life.

He had always loved those who were his in the world, but now he showed how perfect his love was.  They were at supper, and the devil had already put it into the mind of Judas Iscariot son of Simon, to betray him.  Jesus knew that the Father had put everything into his hands, and that he had come from God and was returning to God,  and he got up from table, removed his outer garment and, taking a towel, wrapped it round his waist;  he then poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet and to wipe them with the towel he was wearing.  He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, ‘Lord, are you going to wash my feet?’  Jesus answered, ‘At the moment you do not know what I am doing, but later you will understand’.  ‘Never!’ said Peter ‘You shall never wash my feet.’ Jesus replied, ‘If I do not wash you, you can have nothing in common with me’.  ‘Then, Lord,’ said Simon Peter ‘not only my feet, but my hands and my head as well!’  Jesus said, ‘No one who has taken a bath needs washing, he is clean all over. You too are clean, though not all of you are.’  He knew who was going to betray him, that was why he said, ‘though not all of you are’.  When he had washed their feet and put on his clothes again he went back to the table. ‘Do you understand’ he said ‘what I have done to you?  You call me Master and Lord, and rightly; so I am.  If I, then, the Lord and Master, have washed your feet, you should wash each other’s feet.  I have given you an example so that you may copy what I have done to you.  ‘I tell you most solemnly, no servant is greater than his master, no messenger is greater than the man who sent him.  ‘Now that you know this, happiness will be yours if you behave accordingly.  I am not speaking about all of you: I know the ones I have chosen; but what scripture says must be fulfilled: Someone who shares my table rebels against me.  ‘I tell you this now, before it happens, so that when it does happen you may believe that I am He.

At that instant, after Judas had taken the bread, Satan entered him. Jesus then said, ‘What you are going to do, do quickly’.  None of the others at table understood the reason he said this.  Since Judas had charge of the common fund, some of them thought Jesus was telling him, ‘Buy what we need for the festival’, or telling him to give something to the poor.  As soon as Judas had taken the piece of bread he went out. Night had fallen.  When he had gone Jesus said: ‘Now has the Son of Man been glorified, and in him God has been glorified.

By this love you have for one another, everyone will know that you are my disciples.’  Simon Peter said, ‘Lord, where are you going?’ Jesus replied, ‘Where I am going you cannot follow me now; you will follow me later’.  Peter said to him, ‘Why can’t I follow you now? I will lay down my life for you.’  ‘Lay down your life for me?’ answered Jesus. ‘I tell you most solemnly, before the cock crows you will have disowned me three times.  ‘Do not let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God still, and trust in me.  There are many rooms in my Father’s house; if there were not, I should have told you. I am going now to prepare a place for you,  and after I have gone and prepared you a place, I shall return to take you with me; so that where I am you may be too.

No one can come to the Father except through me.  If you know me, you know my Father too. From this moment you know him and have seen him.’  Philip said, ‘Lord, let us see the Father and then we shall be satisfied’.  ‘Have I been with you all this time, Philip,’ said Jesus to him ‘and you still do not know me? ‘To have seen me is to have seen the, Father, so how can you say, “Let us see the Father”?  Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words I say to you I do not speak as from myself: it is the Father, living in me, who is doing this work.  You must believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; believe it on the evidence of this work, if for no other reason.  I tell you most solemnly, whoever believes in me will perform the same works as I do myself, he will perform even greater works, because I am going to the Father.  Whatever you ask for in my name I will do, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son.  If you ask for anything in my name, I will do it.  If you love me you will keep my commandments.  I shall ask the Father, and he will give you another Advocate to be with you for ever,  that Spirit of truth whom the world can never receive since it neither sees nor knows him; but you know him, because he is with you, he is in you.  I will not leave you orphans; I will come back to you.  In a short time the world will no longer see me; but you will see me, because I live and you will live.  On that day you will understand that I am in my Father and you in me and I in you.  Anybody who receives my commandments and keeps them will be one who loves me; and anybody who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I shall love him and show myself to him.’  Judas – this was not Judas Iscariot – said to him, ‘Lord, what is all this about? Do you intend to show yourself to us and not to the world?’  Jesus replied: ‘If anyone loves me he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we shall come to him and make our home with him.  Those who do not love me do not keep my words. And my word is not my own: it is the word of the one who sent me.  I have said these things to you while still with you;  but the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you everything and remind you of all I have said to you.  Peace I bequeath to you, my own peace I give you, a peace the world cannot give, this is my gift to you. Do not let your hearts be troubled or afraid.  You heard me say: I am going away, and shall return. If you loved me you would have been glad to know that I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I.  I have told you this now before it happens, so that when it does happen you may believe.  I shall not talk with you any longer, because the prince of this world is on his way. He has no power over me,  but the world must be brought to know that I love the Father and that I am doing exactly what the Father told me. Come now, let us go."

It was Caiaphas who had suggested to the Jews, ‘It is better for one man to die for the people’.  Simon Peter, with another disciple, followed Jesus. This disciple, who was known to the high priest, went with Jesus into the high priest’s palace,  but Peter stayed outside the door. So the other disciple, the one known to the high priest, went out, spoke to the woman who was keeping the door and brought Peter in.  The maid on duty at the door said to Peter, ‘Aren’t you another of that man’s disciples?’ He answered, ‘I am not’.  Now it was cold, and the servants and guards had lit a charcoal fire and were standing there warming themselves; so Peter stood there too, warming himself with the others.  The high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching.  Jesus answered, ‘I have spoken openly for all the world to hear; I have always taught in the synagogue and in the Temple where all the Jews meet together: I have said nothing in secret.  But why ask me? Ask my hearers what I taught: they know what I said.’  At these words, one of the guards standing by gave Jesus a slap in the face, saying, ‘Is that the way to answer the high priest?’  Jesus replied, ‘If there is something wrong in what I said, point it out; but if there is no offence in it, why do you strike me?’  Then Annas sent him, still bound, to Caiaphas the high priest.  As Simon Peter stood there warming himself, someone said to him, ‘Aren’t you another of his disciples?’ He denied it saying, ‘I am not’.  One of the high priest’s servants, a relation of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, said, ‘Didn’t I see you in the garden with him?’  Again Peter denied it; and at once a cock crew."

They did not go into the Praetorium themselves or they would be defiled and unable to eat the passover.  So Pilate came outside to them and said, ‘What charge do you bring against this man?’ They replied,  ‘If he were not a criminal, we should not be handing him over to you’.  Pilate said, ‘Take him yourselves, and try him by your own Law’. The Jews answered, ‘We are not allowed to put a man to death’.  This was to fulfil the words Jesus had spoken indicating the way he was going to die.  So Pilate went back into the Praetorium and called Jesus to him, ‘Are you the king of the Jews?’ he asked.  Jesus replied, ‘Do you ask this of your own accord, or have others spoken to you about me?’  Pilate answered, ‘Am I a Jew? It is your own people and the chief priests who have handed you over to me: what have you done?’  Jesus replied, ‘Mine is not a kingdom of this world; if my kingdom were of this world, my men would have fought to prevent my being surrendered to the Jews. But my kingdom is not of this kind.’  ‘So you are a king then?’ said Pilate. ‘It is you who say it’ answered Jesus. ‘Yes, I am a king. I was born for this, I came into the world for this: to bear witness to the truth; and all who are on the side of truth listen to my voice.’  ‘Truth?’ said Pilate ‘What is that?’; and with that he went out again to the Jews and said, ‘I find no case against him.  But according to a custom of yours I should release one prisoner at the Passover; would you like me, then, to release the king of the Jews?’  At this they shouted: ‘Not this man,’ they said ‘but Barabbas’. Barabbas was a brigand.  Pilate then had Jesus taken away and scourged;  and after this, the soldiers twisted some thorns into a crown and put it on his head, and dressed him in a purple robe.  They kept coming up to him and saying, ‘Hail, king of the Jews!’; and they slapped him in the face.  Pilate came outside again and said to them, ‘Look, I am going to bring him out to you to let you see that I find no case’.  Jesus then came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said, ‘Here is the man’.  When they saw him the chief priests and the guards shouted, ‘Crucify him! Crucify him!’ Pilate said, ‘Take him yourselves and crucify him: I can find no case against him’.  ‘We have a Law,’ the Jews replied ‘and according to that Law he ought to die, because he has claimed to be the Son of God.’  When Pilate heard them say this his fears increased.  Re-entering the Praetorium, he said to Jesus, ‘Where do you come from?’ But Jesus made no answer.  Pilate then said to him, ‘Are you refusing to speak to me? Surely you know I have power to release you and I have power to crucify you?’  ‘You would have no power over me’ replied Jesus ‘if it had not been given you from above; that is why the one who handed me over to you has the greater guilt.’"

It was Passover Preparation Day, about the sixth hour. ‘Here is your king’ said Pilate to the Jews.  ‘Take him away, take him away!’ they said. ‘Crucify him!’ ‘Do you want me to crucify your king?’ said Pilate. The chief priests answered, ‘We have no king except Caesar’.  So in the end Pilate handed him over to them to be crucified."

This notice was read by many of the Jews, because the place where Jesus was crucified was not far from the city, and the writing was in Hebrew, Latin and Greek.  So the Jewish chief priests said to Pilate, ‘You should not write “King of the Jews”, but “This man said: I am King of the Jews”‘.  Pilate answered, ‘What I have written, I have written’."

When they came to Jesus, they found he was already dead, and so instead of breaking his legs  one of the soldiers pierced his side with a lance; and immediately there came out blood and water.  This is the evidence of one who saw it – trustworthy evidence, and he knows he speaks the truth – and he gives it so that you may believe as well.

Jesus said, ‘Woman, why are you weeping? Who are you looking for?’ Supposing him to be the gardener, she said, ‘Sir, if you have taken him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will go and remove him’.  Jesus said, ‘Mary!’ She knew him then and said to him in Hebrew, ‘Rabbuni!’ – which means Master.  Jesus said to her, ‘Do not cling to me, because I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go and find the brothers, and tell them: I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’  So Mary of Magdala went and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord and that he had said these things to her."

He said to them, ‘Peace be with you’,  and showed them his hands and his side. The disciples were filled with joy when they saw the Lord,  and he said to them again, ‘Peace be with you. ‘As the Father sent me, so am I sending you.’  After saying this he breathed on them and said: ‘Receive the Holy Spirit.  For those whose sins you forgive, they are forgiven; for those whose sins you retain, they are retained.’  Thomas, called the Twin, who was one of the Twelve, was not with them when Jesus came.  When the disciples said, ‘We have seen the Lord’, he answered, ‘Unless I see the holes that the nails made in his hands and can put my finger into the holes they made, and unless I can put my hand into his side, I refuse to believe’.  Eight days later the disciples were in the house again and Thomas was with them. The doors were closed, but Jesus came in and stood among them. ‘Peace be with you’ he said.  Then he spoke to Thomas, ‘Put your finger here; look, here are my hands. Give me your hand; put it into my side. Doubt no longer but believe.’  Thomas replied, ‘My Lord and my God!’  Jesus said to him: ‘You believe because you can see me. Happy are those who have not seen and yet believe.’  There were many other signs that Jesus worked and the disciples saw, but they are not recorded in this book.  These are recorded so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing this you may have life through his name."

It was by the Sea of Tiberias, and it happened like this:  Simon Peter, Thomas called the Twin, Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee and two more of his disciples were together.  Simon Peter said, ‘I’m going fishing’. They replied, ‘We’ll come with you’. They went out and got into the boat but caught nothing that night.  It was light by now and there stood Jesus on the shore, though the disciples did not realise that it was Jesus.  Jesus called out, ‘Have you caught anything, friends?’ And when they answered, ‘No’,  he said, ‘Throw the net out to starboard and you’ll find something’. So they dropped the net, and there were so many fish that they could not haul it in.  The disciple Jesus loved said to Peter, ‘It is the Lord’. At these words ‘It is the Lord’, Simon Peter, who had practically nothing on, wrapped his cloak round him and jumped into the water.  The other disciples came on in the boat, towing the net and the fish; they were only about a hundred yards from land.  As soon as they came ashore they saw that there was some bread there, and a charcoal fire with fish cooking on it.  Jesus said, ‘Bring some of the fish you have just caught’.  Simon Peter went aboard and dragged the net to the shore, full of big fish, one hundred and fifty-three of them; and in spite of there being so many the net was not broken.  Jesus said to them, ‘Come and have breakfast’. None of the disciples was bold enough to ask, ‘Who are you?’; they knew quite well it was the Lord.  Jesus then stepped forward, took the bread and gave it to them, and the same with the fish.  This was the third time that Jesus showed himself to the disciples after rising from the dead.  After the meal Jesus said to Simon Peter, ‘Simon son of John, do you love me more than these others do?’ He answered, ‘Yes Lord, you know I love you’. Jesus said to him, ‘Feed my lambs’.  A second time he said to him, ‘Simon son of John, do you love me?’ He replied, ‘Yes, Lord, you know I love you’. Jesus said to him, ‘Look after my sheep’.  Then he said to him a third time, ‘Simon son of John, do you love me?’ Peter was upset that he asked him the third time, ‘Do you love me?’ and said, ‘Lord, you know everything; you know I love you’. Jesus said to him, ‘Feed my sheep.  ‘I tell you most solemnly, when you were young you put on your own belt and walked where you liked; but when you grow old you will stretch out your hands, and somebody else will put a belt round you and take you where you would rather not go.’  In these words he indicated the kind of death by which Peter would give glory to God. After this he said, ‘Follow me’.  Peter turned and saw the disciple Jesus loved following them – the one who had leaned on his breast at the supper and had said to him, ‘Lord, who is it that will betray you?’  Seeing him, Peter said to Jesus, ‘What about him, Lord?’  Jesus answered, ‘If I want him to stay behind till I come, what does it matter to you? You are to follow me.’  The rumour then went out among the brothers that this disciple would not die. Yet Jesus had not said to Peter, ‘He will not die’, but, ‘If I want him to stay behind till I come’."

Both were worthy in the sight of God, and scrupulously observed all the commandments and observances of the Lord.  But they were childless: Elizabeth was barren and they were both getting on in years.  Now it was the turn of Zechariah’s section to serve, and he was exercising his priestly office before God  when it fell to him by lot, as the ritual custom was, to enter the Lord’s sanctuary and burn incense there.  And at the hour of incense the whole congregation was outside, praying.  Then there appeared to him the angel of the Lord, standing on the right of the altar of incense.  The sight disturbed Zechariah and he was overcome with fear.  But the angel said to him, ‘Zechariah, do not be afraid, your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth is to bear you a son and you must name him John.  He will be your joy and delight and many will rejoice at his birth,  for he will be great in the sight of the Lord; he must drink no wine, no strong drink. Even from his mother’s womb he will be filled with the Holy Spirit,  and he will bring back many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God.  With the spirit and power of Elijah, he will go before him to turn the hearts of fathers towards their children and the disobedient back to the wisdom that the virtuous have, preparing for the Lord a people fit for him.  Zechariah said to the angel, ‘How can I be sure of this? I am an old man and my wife is getting on in years.’  The angel replied, ‘I am Gabriel who stand in God’s presence, and I have been sent to speak to you and bring you this good news.  Listen! Since you have not believed my words, which will come true at their appointed time, you will be silenced and have no power of speech until this has happened.’  Meanwhile the people were waiting for Zechariah and were surprised that he stayed in the sanctuary so long.  When he came out he could not speak to them, and they realised that he had received a vision in the sanctuary. But he could only make signs to them, and remained dumb.  When his time of service came to an end he returned home.  Some time later his wife Elizabeth conceived, and for five months she kept to herself.  ‘The Lord has done this for me’ she said ‘now that it has pleased him to take away the humiliation I suffered among men.’"

The Lord is with you.’  She was deeply disturbed by these words and asked herself what this greeting could mean,  but the angel said to her, ‘Mary, do not be afraid; you have won God’s favour.  Listen! You are to conceive and bear a son, and you must name him Jesus.  He will be great and will be called Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his ancestor David;  he will rule over the House of Jacob for ever and his reign will have no end.’  Mary said to the angel, ‘But how can this come about, since I am a virgin?'  ‘The Holy Spirit will come upon you’ the angel answered ‘and the power of the Most High will cover you with its shadow.

In the countryside close by there were shepherds who lived in the fields and took it in turns to watch their flocks during the night.  The angel of the Lord appeared to them and the glory of the Lord shone round them. They were terrified,  but the angel said, ‘Do not be afraid. Listen, I bring you news of great joy, a joy to be shared by the whole people.  Today in the town of David a saviour has been born to you; he is Christ the Lord.  And here is a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger.’  And suddenly with the angel there was a great throng of the heavenly host, praising God and singing:  ‘Glory to God in the highest heaven, and peace to men who enjoy his favour’  Now when the angels had gone from them into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, ‘Let us go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened which the Lord has made known to us’.  So they hurried away and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in the manger.  When they saw the child they repeated what they had been told about him,  and everyone who heard it was astonished at what the shepherds had to say.  As for Mary, she treasured all these things and pondered them in her heart.  And the shepherds went back glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen; it was exactly as they had been told."

He went through the whole Jordan district proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins,  as it is written in the book of the sayings of the prophet Isaiah: A voice cries in the wilderness: Prepare a way for the Lord, make his paths straight.  Every valley will be filled in, every mountain and hill be laid low, winding ways will be straightened and rough roads made smooth.  And all mankind shall see the salvation of God.  He said, therefore, to the crowds who came to be baptised by him, ‘Brood of vipers, who warned you to fly from the retribution that is coming?  But if you are repentant, produce the appropriate fruits, and do not think of telling yourselves, “We have Abraham for our father” because, I tell you, God can raise children for Abraham from these stones.  Yes, even now the axe is laid to the roots of the trees, so that any tree which fails to produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown on the fire.’  When all the people asked him, ‘What must we do, then?’  he answered, ‘If anyone has two tunics he must share with the man who has none, and the one with something to eat must do the same’.  There were tax collectors too who came for baptism, and these said to him, ‘Master, what must we do?’  He said to them, ‘Exact no more than your rate’.  Some soldiers asked him in their turn, ‘What about us? What must we do?’ He said to them, ‘No intimidation! No extortion! Be content with your pay!’  A feeling of expectancy had grown among the people, who were beginning to think that John might be the Christ,  so John declared before them all, ‘I baptise you with water, but someone is coming, someone who is more powerful than I am, and I am not fit to undo the strap of his sandals; he will baptise you with the Holy Spirit and fire.  His winnowing-fan is in his hand to clear his threshing-floor and to gather the wheat into his barn; but the chaff he will burn in a fire that will never go out.’  As well as this, there were many other things he said to exhort the people and to announce the Good News to them."

He has sent me to bring the good news to the poor, to proclaim liberty to captives and to the blind new sight, to set the downtrodden free,  to proclaim the Lord’s year of favour.  He then rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the assistant and sat down. And all eyes in the synagogue were fixed on him.  Then he began to speak to them, ‘This text is being fulfilled today even as you listen’.  And he won the approval of all, and they were astonished by the gracious words that came from his lips They said, ‘This is Joseph’s son, surely?’  But he replied, ‘No doubt you will quote me the saying, “Physician, heal yourself” and tell me, “We have heard all that happened in Capernaum, do the same here in your own countryside”‘.  And he went on, ‘I tell you solemnly, no prophet is ever accepted in his own country.  ‘There were many widows in Israel, I can assure you, in Elijah’s day, when heaven remained shut for three years and six months and a great famine raged throughout the land,  but Elijah was not sent to any one of these: he was sent to a widow at Zarephath, a Sidonian town.  And in the prophet Elisha’s time there were many lepers in Israel, but none of these was cured, except the Syrian, Naaman.’  When they heard this everyone in the synagogue was enraged.  They sprang to their feet and hustled him out of the town; and they took him up to the brow of the hill their town was built on, intending to throw him down the cliff,  but he slipped through the crowd and walked away."

When Simon Peter saw this he fell at the knees of Jesus saying, ‘Leave me, Lord; I am a sinful man’.  For he and all his companions were completely overcome by the catch they had made;  so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were Simon’s partners.

Seeing their faith he said, ‘My friend, your sins are forgiven you’.  The scribes and the Pharisees began to think this over. ‘Who is this man talking blasphemy? Who can forgive sins but God alone?’  But Jesus, aware of their thoughts, made them this reply, ‘What are these thoughts you have in your hearts?  Which of these is easier: to say, “Your sins are forgiven you” or to say, “Get up and walk”?  But to prove to you that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins,’-he said to the paralysed man-‘I order you: get up, and pick up your stretcher and go home.’  And immediately before their very eyes he got up, picked up what he had been lying on and went home praising God.

If you love those who love you, what thanks can you expect? Even sinners love those who love them.  And if you do good to those who do good to you, what thanks can you expect? For even sinners do that much.  And if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what thanks can you expect? Even sinners lend to sinners to get back the same amount.  Instead, love your enemies and do good, and lend without any hope of return. You will have a great reward, and you will be sons of the Most High, for he himself is kind to the ungrateful and the wicked."

When they came to Jesus they pleaded earnestly with him. ‘He deserves this of you’ they said  ‘because he is friendly towards our people; in fact, he is the one who built the synagogue.’  So Jesus went with them, and was not very far from the house when the centurion sent word to him by some friends: ‘Sir,’ he said ‘do not put yourself to trouble; because I am not worthy to have you under my roof;  and for this same reason I did not presume to come to you myself; but give the word and let my servant be cured.  For I am under authority myself, and have soldiers under me; and I say to one man: Go, and he goes; to another: Come here, and he comes; to my servant: Do this, and he does it.’  When Jesus heard these words he was astonished at him and, turning round, said to the crowd following him, ‘I tell you, not even in Israel have I found faith like this’.

I implore you, do not torture me.’ .  -For Jesus had been telling the unclean spirit to come out of the man. It was a devil that had seized on him a great many times, and then they used to secure him with chains and fetters to restrain him, but he would always break the fastenings, and the devil would drive him out into the wilds.  ‘What is your name?’ Jesus asked. ‘Legion’ he said-because many devils had gone into him.  And these pleaded with him not to order them to depart into the Abyss.  Now there was a large herd of pigs feeding there on the mountain, and the devils pleaded with him to let them go into these. So he gave them leave.  The devils came out of the man and went into the pigs, and the herd charged down the cliff into the lake and were drowned.  When the swineherds saw what had happened they ran off and told their story in the town and in the country round about;  and the people went out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus they found the man from whom the devils had gone out sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his full senses; and they were afraid.  Those who had witnessed it told them how the man who had been possessed came to be healed.  The entire population of the Gerasene territory was in a state of panic and asked Jesus to leave them. So he got into the boat and went back.  The man from whom the devils had gone out asked to be allowed to stay with him, but he sent him away.  ‘Go back home,’ he said ‘and report all that God has done for you.’ So the man went off and spread throughout the town all that Jesus had done for him."

I felt that power had gone out from me.’  Seeing herself discovered, the woman came forward trembling, and falling at his feet explained in front of all the  people why she had touched him and how she had been cured at that very moment. ‘My daughter,’ he said ‘your faith has restored you to health; go in peace.’  While he was still speaking, someone arrived from the house of the synagogue official to say, ‘Your daughter has died. Do not trouble the Master any further.’  But Jesus had heard this, and he spoke to the man, ‘Do not be afraid, only have faith and she will be safe’.  When he came to the house he allowed no one to go in with him except Peter and John and James, and the child’s father and mother.  They were all weeping and mourning for her, but Jesus said, ‘Stop crying; she is not dead, but asleep’.  But they laughed at him, knowing she was dead.  But taking her by the hand he called to her, ‘Child, get up’.  And her spirit returned and she got up at once. Then he told them to give her something to eat.  Her parents were astonished, but he ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened."

Start off now, but remember, I am sending you out like lambs among wolves.  Carry no purse, no haversack, no sandals. Salute no one on the road.  Whatever house you go into, let your first words be, “Peace to this house!”  And if a man of peace lives there, your peace will go and rest on him; if not, it will come back to you.  Stay in the same house, taking what food and drink they have to offer, for the labourer deserves his wages; do not move from house to house.  Whenever you go into a town where they make you welcome, eat what is set before you.  Cure those in it who are sick, and say, “The kingdom of God is very near to you”.  But whenever you enter a town and they do not make you welcome, go out into its streets and say, .  “We wipe off the very dust of your town that clings to our feet, and leave it with you. Yet be sure of this: the kingdom of God is very near.”  I tell you, on that day it will not go as hard with Sodom as with that town.  ‘Alas for you, Chorazin! Alas for you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.  And still, it will not go as hard with Tyre and Sidon at the Judgement as with you.  And as for you, Capernaum, did you want to be exalted high as heaven? You shall be thrown down to hell.  ‘Anyone who listens to you listens to me; anyone who rejects you rejects me, and those who reject me reject the one who sent me.’"

But the synagogue official was indignant because Jesus had healed on the sabbath, and he addressed the people present. ‘There are six days’ he said ‘when work is to be done. Come and be healed on one of those days and not on the sabbath.’  But the Lord answered him. ‘Hypocrites!’ he said ‘Is there one of you who does not untie his ox or his donkey from the manger on the sabbath and take it out for watering?  And this woman, a daughter of Abraham whom Satan has held bound these eighteen years – was it not right to untie her bonds on the sabbath day?’  When he said this, all his adversaries were covered with confusion, and all the people were overjoyed at all the wonders he worked."

And he would willingly have filled his belly with the husks the pigs were eating but no one offered him anything.  Then he came to his senses and said, “How many of my father’s paid servants have more food than they want, and here am I dying of hunger!  I will leave is this place and go to my father and say: Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you;  I no longer deserve to be called your son; treat me as one of your paid servants.”  So he left the place and went back to his father. ‘While he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was moved with pity. He ran to the boy, clasped him in his arms and kissed him tenderly.  Then his son said, “Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I no longer deserve to be called your son.”  But the father said to his servants, “Quick! Bring out the best robe and put it on him; put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.  Bring the calf we have been fattening, and kill it; we are going to have a feast, a celebration,  because this son of mine was dead and has come back to life; he was lost and is found.” And they began to celebrate.  ‘Now the elder son was out in the fields, and on his way back, as he drew near the house, he could hear music and dancing.  Calling one of the servants he asked what it was all about.  “Your brother has come” replied the servant “and your father has killed the calf we had fattened because he has got him back safe and sound.”  He was angry then and refused to go in, and his father came out to plead with him;  but he answered his father, “Look, all these years I have slaved for you and never once disobeyed your orders, yet you never offered me so much as a kid for me to celebrate with my friends.  But, for this son of yours, when he comes back after swallowing up your property – he and his women – you kill the calf we had been fattening.”  The father said, “My son, you are with me always and all I have is yours.  But it was only right we should celebrate and rejoice, because your brother here was dead and has come to life; he was lost and is found.”‘"

He summoned ten of his servants and gave them ten pounds. “Do business with these” he told them “until I get back.”  But his compatriots detested him and sent a delegation to follow him with this message, “We do not want this man to be our king”.  Now on his return, having received his appointment as king, he sent for those servants to whom he had given the money, to find out what profit each had made.  The first came in and said, “Sir, your one pound has brought in ten”.  “Well done, my good servant!” he replied “Since you have proved yourself faithful in a very small thing, you shall have the government of ten cities.”.  Then came the second and said, “Sir, your one pound has made five”.  To this one also he said, “And you shall be in charge of five cities”.  Next came the other and said, “Sir, here is your pound. I put it away safely in a piece of linen  because I was afraid of you; for you are an exacting man: you pick up what you have not put down and reap what you have not sown.”  “You wicked servant!” he said “Out of your own mouth I condemn you. So you knew I was an exacting man, picking up what I have not put down and reaping what I have not sown?  Then why did you not put my money in the bank? On my return I could have drawn it out with interest.”  And he said to those standing by, “Take the pound from him and give it to the man who has ten pounds”.  And they said to him, “But, sir, he has ten pounds . . .”  “I tell you, to everyone who has will be given more; but from the man who has not, even what he has will be taken away.  “But as for my enemies who did not want me for their king, bring them here and execute them in my presence.”‘"

Perhaps they will respect him.”  But when the tenants saw him they put their heads together. “This is the heir,” they said “let us kill him so that the inheritance will be ours.”  So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. Now what will the owner of the vineyard do to them?  He will come and make an end of these tenants and give the vineyard to others.’ Hearing this they said, ‘God forbid!’  But he looked hard at them and said, ‘Then what does this text in the scriptures mean: It was the stone rejected by the builders that became the keystone?  Anyone who falls on that stone will be dashed to pieces; anyone it falls on will be crushed.’  But for their fear of the people, the scribes and the chief priests would have liked to lay hands on him that very moment, because they realised that this parable was aimed at them."

Now as they talked this over, Jesus himself came up and walked by their side;  but something prevented them from recognising him.  He said to them, ‘What matters are you discussing as you walk along?’ They stopped short, their faces downcast.  Then one of them, called Cleopas, answered him, ‘You must be the only is person staying in Jerusalem who does not know the things that have been happening there these last few days’.  ‘What things?’ he asked. ‘All about Jesus of Nazareth’ they answered ‘who proved he was a great prophet by the things he said and did in the sight of God and of the whole people;  and how our chief priests and our leaders handed him over to be sentenced to death, and had him crucified.  Our own hope had been that he would be the one to set Israel free. And this is not all: two whole days have gone by since it all happened;  and some women from our group have astounded us: they went to the tomb in the early morning,  and when they did not find the body, they came back to tell us they had seen a vision of angels who declared he was alive.  Some of our friends went to the tomb and found everything exactly as the women had reported, but of him they saw nothing.’  Then he said to them, ‘You foolish men! So slow to believe the full message of the prophets!  Was it not ordained that the Christ should suffer and so enter into his glory?’  Then, starting with Moses and going through all the prophets, he explained to them the passages throughout the scriptures that were about himself.  When they drew near to the village to which they were going, he made as if to go on;  but they pressed him to stay with them. ‘It is nearly evening’ they said ‘and the day is almost over.’ So he went in to stay with them.  Now while he was with them at table, he took the bread and said the blessing; then he broke it and handed it to them.  And their eyes were opened and they recognised him; but he had vanished from their sight.  Then they said to each other, ‘Did not our hearts burn within us as he talked to us on the road and explained the scriptures to us?’  They set out that instant and returned to Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven assembled together with their companions,  who said to them, ‘Yes, it is true. The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon.’  Then they told their story of what had happened on the road and how they had recognised him at the breaking of bread."

He is blaspheming. Who can forgive sins but God?’  Jesus, inwardly aware that this was what they were thinking, said to them, ‘Why do you have these thoughts in your hearts?  Which of these is easier: to say to the paralytic, “Your sins are forgiven” or to say, “Get up, pick up your stretcher and walk”?  But to prove to you that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins,’ –  he said to the paralytic – I order you: get up, pick up your stretcher, and go off home.’  And the man got up, picked up his stretcher at once and walked out in front of everyone, so that they were all astounded and praised God saying, ‘We have never seen anything like this’."

As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they could not think of fasting.  But the time will come for the bridegroom to be taken away from them, and then, on that day, they will fast.

All night and all day, among the tombs and in the mountains, he would howl and gash himself with stones.  Catching sight of Jesus from a distance, he ran up and fell at his feet  and shouted at the top of his voice, ‘What do you want with me, Jesus, son of the Most High God? Swear by God you will not torture me!’  – For Jesus had been saying to him, ‘Come out of the man, unclean spirit’.  ‘What is your name?’ Jesus asked. ‘My name is legion,’ he answered ‘for there are many of us.’  And he begged him earnestly not to send them out of the district.  Now there was there on the mountainside a great herd of pigs feeding,  and the unclean spirits begged him, ‘Send us to the pigs, let us go into them’.  So he gave them leave. With that, the unclean spirits came out and went into the pigs, and the herd of about two thousand pigs charged down the cliff into the lake, and there they were drowned.  The swineherds ran off and told their story in the town and in the country round about; and the people came to see what had really happened.  They came to Jesus and saw the demoniac sitting there, clothed and in his full senses – the very man who had had the legion in him before – and they were afraid.  And those who had witnessed it reported what had happened to the demoniac and what had become of the pigs.  Then they began to implore Jesus to leave the neighbourhood.  As he was getting into the boat, the man who had been possessed begged to be allowed to stay with him.  Jesus would not let him but said to him, ‘Go home to your people and tell them all that the Lord in his mercy has done for you’.  So the man went off and proceeded to spread throughout the Decapolis all that Jesus had done for him. And everyone was amazed."

Then one of the synagogue officials came up, Jairus by name, and seeing him, fell at his feet  and pleaded with him earnestly, saying, ‘My little daughter is desperately sick. Do come and lay your hands on her to make her better and save her life.’  Jesus went with him and a large crowd followed him; they were pressing all round him.  Now there was a woman who had suffered from a haemorrhage for twelve years;  after long and painful treatment under various doctors, she spent all she had without being any the better for it, in fact, she was getting worse.  She had heard about Jesus, and she came up behind him through the crowd and touched his cloak.  ‘If I can touch even his clothes,’ she had told herself ‘I shall be well again.’  And the source of the bleeding dried up instantly, and she felt in herself that she was cured of her complaint.  Immediately aware that power had gone out from him, Jesus turned round in the crowd and said, ‘Who touched my clothes?’  His disciples said to him, ‘You see how the crowd is pressing round you and yet you say, “Who touched me?”‘  But he continued to look all round to see who had done it.  Then the woman came forward, frightened and trembling because she knew what had happened to her, and she fell at his feet and told him the whole truth.  ‘My daughter,’ he said ‘your faith has restored you to health; go in peace and be free from your complaint.’  While he was still speaking some people arrived from the house of the synagogue official to say, ‘Your daughter is dead: why put the Master to any further trouble?’  But Jesus had overheard this remark of theirs and he said to the official, ‘Do not be afraid; only have faith’.  And he allowed no one to go with him except Peter and James and John the brother of James.  So they came to the official’s house and Jesus noticed all the commotion, with people weeping and wailing unrestrainedly.  He went in and said to them, ‘Why all this commotion and crying? The child is not dead, but asleep.’  But they laughed at him. So he turned them all out and, taking with him the child’s father and mother and his own companions, he went into the place where the child lay.  And taking the child by the hand he said to her, ‘Talitha, kum!’ which means, ‘Little girl, I tell you to get up’.  The little girl got up at once and began to walk about, for she was twelve years old. At this they were overcome with astonishment,  and he ordered them strictly not to let anyone know about it, and told them to give her something to eat."

As for Herodias, she was furious with him and wanted to kill him; but she was not able to,  because Herod was afraid of John, knowing him to be a good and holy man, and gave him his protection. When he had heard him speak he was greatly perplexed, and yet he liked to listen to him.  An opportunity came on Herod’s birthday when he gave a banquet for the nobles of his court, for his army officers and for the leading figures in Galilee.  When the daughter of this same Herodias came in and danced, she delighted Herod and his guests; so the king said to the girl, ‘Ask me anything you like and I will give it you’.  And he swore her an oath, ‘I will give you anything you ask, even half my kingdom’.  She went out and said to her mother, ‘What shall I ask for?’ She replied, ‘The head of John the Baptist’  The girl hurried straight back to the king and made her request, ‘I want you to give me John the Baptist’s head, here and now, on a dish’.  The king was deeply distressed but, thinking of the oaths he had sworn and of his guests, he was reluctant to break his word to her.  So the king at once sent one of the bodyguard with orders to bring John’s head.  The man went off and beheaded him in prison; then he brought the head on a dish and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother.

He replied, ‘Give them something to eat yourselves’. They answered, ‘Are we to go and spend two hundred denarii on bread for them to eat?’  How many loaves have you?’ he asked ‘Go and see.’ And when they had found out they said, ‘Five, and two fish’.  Then he ordered them to get all the people together in groups on the green grass,  and they sat down on the ground in squares of hundreds and fifties.

        "text": "The Pharisees and some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem gathered round him,  and they noticed that some of his disciples were eating with unclean hands, that is, without washing them.  For the Pharisees, and the Jews in general, follow the tradition of the elders and never eat without washing their arms as far as the elbow;  and on returning from the market place they never eat without first sprinkling themselves. There are also many other observances which have been handed down to them concerning the washing of cups and pots and bronze dishes.  So these Pharisees and scribes asked him, ‘Why do your disciples not respect the tradition of the elders but eat their food with unclean hands?’  He answered, ‘It was of you hypocrites that Isaiah so rightly prophesied in this passage of scripture: This people honours me only with lip-service, while their hearts are far from me.  The worship they offer me is worthless, the doctrines they teach are only human regulations.  You put aside the commandment of God to cling to human traditions.’  And he said to them, ‘How ingeniously you get round the commandment of God in order to preserve your own tradition!  For Moses said: Do your duty to your father and your mother, and, Anyone who curses father or mother must be put to death.  But you say, “If a man says to his father or mother: Anything I have that I might have used to help you is Corban (that is, dedicated to God),  then he is forbidden from that moment to do anything for his father or mother”.  In this way you make God’s word null and void for the sake of your tradition which you have handed down. And you do many other things like this.’"

Nothing that goes into a man from outside can make him unclean; it is the things that come out of a man that make him unclean.  If anyone has ears to hear, let him listen to this.’  When he had gone back into the house, away from the crowd, his disciples questioned him about the parable.  He said to them, ‘Do you not understand either? Can you not see that whatever goes into a man from outside cannot make him unclean,  because it does not go into his heart but through his stomach and passes out into the sewer?’ (Thus he pronounced all foods clean.)  And he went on, ‘It is what comes out of a man that makes him unclean.  For it is from within, from men’s hearts, that evil intentions emerge: fornication, theft, murder, adultery,  avarice, malice, deceit, indecency, envy, slander, pride, folly.  All these evil things come from within and make a man unclean.’"

But she spoke up: ‘Ah yes, sir,’ she replied ‘but the house-dogs under the table can eat the children’s scraps’.

Bring him to me.’  They brought the boy to him, and as soon as the spirit saw Jesus it threw the boy into convulsions, and he fell to the ground and lay writhing there, foaming at the mouth.  Jesus asked the father, ‘How long has this been happening to him?’ ‘From childhood,’ he replied  ‘and it has often thrown him into the fire and into the water, in order to destroy him. But if you can do anything, have pity on us and help us.’  ‘If you can?’ retorted Jesus. ‘Everything is possible for anyone who has faith.’  Immediately the father of the boy cried out, ‘I do have faith. Help the little faith I have!’  And when Jesus saw how many people were pressing round him, he rebuked the unclean spirit. ‘Deaf and dumb spirit,’ he said ‘I command you: come out of him and never enter him again.’  Then throwing the boy into violent convulsions it came out shouting, and the boy lay there so like a corpse that most of them said, ‘He is dead’.  But Jesus took him by the hand and helped him up, and he was able to stand.

Nor would he allow anyone to carry anything through the Temple.  And he taught them and said, ‘Does not scripture say: My house will be called a house of prayer for all the peoples? But you have turned it into a robbers’ den.'  This came to the ears of the chief priests and the scribes, and they tried to find some way of doing away with him; they were afraid of him because the people were carried away by his teaching.  And when evening came he went out of the city."

And he sent another and him they killed; then a number of others, and they thrashed some and killed the rest.  He had still someone left: his beloved son. He sent him to them last of all. “They will respect my son” he said.  But those tenants said to each other, “This is the heir. Come on, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.”  So they seized him and killed him and threw him out of the vineyard.  Now what will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and make an end of the tenants and give the vineyard to others.  Have you not read this text of scripture: It was the stone rejected by the builders that became the keystone.  This was the Lord’s doing and it is wonderful to see?  And they would have liked to arrest him, because they realised that the parable was aimed at them, but they were afraid of the crowds.

For when they rise from the dead, men and women do not marry; no, they are like the angels in heaven.  Now about the dead rising again, have you never read in the Book of Moses, in the passage about the Bush, how God spoke to him and said: I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob?

When the crowd went up and began to ask Pilate the customary favour,  Pilate answered them, ‘Do you want me to release for you the king of the Jews?’  For he realised it was out of jealousy that the chief priests had handed Jesus over.  The chief priests, however, had incited the crowd to demand that he should release Barabbas for them instead.  Then Pilate spoke again. ‘But in that case,’ he said to them ‘what am I to do with the man you call king of the Jews?’  They shouted back, ‘Crucify him!’  ‘Why?’ Pilate asked them ‘What harm has he done?’ But they shouted all the louder, ‘Crucify him!’  So Pilate, anxious to placate the crowd, released Barabbas for them and, having ordered Jesus to be scourged, handed him over to be crucified."

Lastly, he showed himself to the Eleven themselves while they were at table. He reproached them for their incredulity and obstinacy, because they had refused to believe those who had seen him after he had risen.  And he said to them, ‘Go out to the whole world; proclaim the Good News to all creation.  He who believes and is baptised will be saved; he who does not believe will be condemned.  These are the signs that will be associated with believers: in my name they will cast out devils; they will have the gift of tongues;  they will pick up snakes in their hands, and be unharmed should they drink deadly poison; they will lay their hands on the sick, who will recover.’  And so the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven: there at the right hand of God he took his place,  while they, going out, preached everywhere, the Lord working with them and confirming the word by the signs that accompanied it."

He had made up his mind to do this when the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, ‘Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because she has conceived what is in her by the Holy Spirit.  She will give birth to a son and you must name him Jesus, because he is the one who is to save his people from their sins.’  Now all this took place to fulfil the words spoken by the Lord through the prophet:  ‘The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son and they will call him Emmanuel, a name which means ‘God-is-with-us’.  When Joseph woke up he did what the angel of the Lord had told him to do: he took his wife to his home  and, though he had not had intercourse with her, she gave birth to a son; and he named him Jesus."

He called together all the chief priests and the scribes of the people, and enquired of them where the Christ was to be born.  ‘At Bethlehem in Judaea,’ they told him ‘for this is what the prophet wrote:  And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, you are by no means least among the leaders of Judah, for out of you will come a leader who will shepherd my people Israel’.  Then Herod summoned the wise men to see him privately. He asked them the exact date on which the star had appeared,  and sent them on to Bethlehem. ‘Go and find out all about the child,’ he said ‘and when you have found him, let me know, so that I too may go and do him homage.’  Having listened to what the king had to say, they set out. And there in front of them was the star they had seen rising; it went forward, and halted over the place where the child was.  The sight of the star filled them with delight,  and going into the house they saw the child with his mother Mary, and falling to their knees they did him homage. Then, opening their treasures, they offered him gifts of gold and frankincense and myrrh.  But they were warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, and returned to their own country by a different way."

This was to fulfil what the Lord had spoken through the prophet: I called my son out of Egypt.

But if you are repentant, produce the appropriate fruit,  and do not presume to tell yourselves, “We have Abraham for our father”, because, I tell you, God can raise children for Abraham from these stones.  Even now the axe is laid to the roots of the trees, so that any tree which fails to produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown on the fire.

But I say this to you: love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you;  in this way you will be sons of your Father in heaven, for he causes his sun to rise on bad men as well as good, and his rain to fall on honest and dishonest men alike.  For if you love those who love you, what right have you to claim any credit? Even the tax collectors do as much, do they not?

Are we not worth much more than they are?  Can any of you, for all his worrying, add one single cubit to his span of life?  And why worry about clothing? Think of the flowers growing in the fields; they never have to work or spin;  yet I assure you that not even Solomon in all his regalia was robed like one of these.  Now if that is how God clothes the grass in the field which is there today and thrown into the furnace tomorrow, will he not much more look after you, you men of little faith?  So do not worry; do not say, “What are we to eat? What are we to drink? How are we to be clothed?”  It is the pagans who set their hearts on all these things. Your heavenly Father knows you need them all.  Set your hearts on his kingdom first, and on his righteousness, and all these other things will be given you as well.

The reason I talk to them in parables is that they look without seeing and listen without hearing or understanding.  So in their case this prophecy of Isaiah is being fulfilled: You will listen and listen again, but not understand, see and see again, but not perceive.  For the heart of this nation has grown coarse, their ears are dull of hearing, and they have shut their eyes, for fear they should see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their heart, and be converted and be healed by me.  ‘But happy are your eyes because they see, your ears because they hear!

They all ate as much as they wanted, and they collected what was left of the scraps, seven baskets full.  Now four thousand men had eaten, to say nothing of women and children.  And when he had sent the crowds away he got into the boat and went to the district of Magadan."

The disciples were amazed when they saw it. ‘What happened to the tree’ they said ‘that it withered there and then?’  Jesus answered, ‘I tell you solemnly, if you have faith and do not doubt at all, not only will you do what I have done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, “Get up and throw yourself into the sea”, it will be done.

There was a man, a landowner, who planted a vineyard; he fenced it round, dug a winepress in it and built a tower; then he leased it to tenants and went abroad.  When vintage time drew near he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his produce.  But the tenants seized his servants, thrashed one, killed another and stoned a third.  Next he sent some more servants, this time a larger number, and they dealt with them in the same way.  Finally he sent his son to them. “They will respect my son” he said.  But when the tenants saw the son, they said to each other, “This is the heir. Come on, let us kill him and take over his inheritance.”  So they seized him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.  Now when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?’  They answered, ‘He will bring those wretches to a wretched end and lease the vineyard to other tenants who will deliver the produce to him when the season arrives’.  Jesus said to them, ‘Have you never read in the scriptures: It was the stone rejected by the builders that became the keystone. This was the Lord’s doing and it is wonderful to see?  I tell you, then, that the kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit.’  When they heard his parables, the chief priests and the scribes realised he was speaking about them,  but though they would have liked to arrest him they were afraid of the crowds, who looked on him as a prophet."

Next he sent some more servants. “Tell those who have been invited” he said “that I have my banquet all prepared, my oxen and fattened cattle have been slaughtered, everything is ready. Come to the wedding.”  But they were not interested: one went off to his farm, another to his business,  and the rest seized his servants, maltreated them and killed them.  The king was furious. He despatched his troops, destroyed those murderers and burnt their town.  Then he said to his servants, “The wedding is ready; but as those who were invited proved to be unworthy,  go to the crossroads in the town and invite everyone you can find to the wedding”.  So these servants went out on to the roads and collected together everyone they could find, bad and good alike; and the wedding hall was filled with guests.  When the king came in to look at the guests he noticed one man who was not wearing a wedding garment,  and said to him, “How did you get in here, my friend, without a wedding garment?” And the man was silent.  Then the king said to the attendants, “Bind him hand and foot and throw him out into the dark, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth”.  For many are called, but few are chosen.’"

I tell you solemnly, wherever in all the world this Good News is proclaimed, what she has done will be told also, in remembrance of her.’"

Nevertheless, let it be as you, not I, would have it.’  He came back to the disciples and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, ‘So you had not the strength to keep awake with me one hour?  You should be awake, and praying not to be put to the test. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.’  Again, a second time, he went away and prayed: ‘My Father,’ he said ‘If this cup cannot pass by without my drinking it, your will be done!’  And he came back again and found them sleeping, their eyes were so heavy.  Leaving them there, he went away again and prayed for the third time, repeating the same words.  Then he came back to the disciples and said to them, ‘You can sleep on now and take your rest. Now the hour has come when the Son of Man is to be betrayed into the hands of sinners.  Get up! Let us go! My betrayer is already close at hand.’"

Jesus said to him, ‘My friend, do what you are here for’. Then they came forward, seized Jesus and took him in charge.  At that, one of the followers of Jesus grasped his sword and drew it; he struck out at the high priest’s servant, and cut off his ear.  Jesus then said, ‘Put your sword back, for all who draw the sword will die by the sword.  Or do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father who would promptly send more than twelve legions of angels to my defence?  But then, how would the scriptures be fulfilled that say this is the way it must be?’  It was at this time that Jesus said to the crowds, ‘Am I a brigand, that you had to set out to capture me with swords and clubs? I sat teaching in the Temple day after day and you never laid hands on me.’  Now all this happened to fulfil the prophecies in scripture. Then all the disciples deserted him and ran away."

The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus, however false, on which they might pass the death-sentence.  But they could not find any, though several lying witnesses came forward. Eventually two stepped forward  and made a statement, ‘This man said, “I have power to destroy the Temple of God and in three days build it up”‘  The high priest then stood up and said to him, ‘Have you no answer to that? What is this evidence these men are bringing against you?’  But Jesus was silent. And the high priest said to him, ‘I put you on oath by the living God to tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God’.  ‘The words are your own’ answered Jesus. ‘Moreover, I tell you that from this time onward you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Power and coming on the clouds of heaven.’  At this, the high priest tore his clothes and said, ‘He has blasphemed. What need of witnesses have we now? There! You have just heard the blasphemy.  What is your opinion?’ They answered, ‘He deserves to die’.  Then they spat in his face and hit him with their fists; others said as they struck him,  ‘Play the prophet, Christ! Who hit you then?’"

Pilate then said to him, ‘Do you not hear how many charges they have brought against you?’  But to the governor’s complete amazement, he offered no reply to any of the charges.  At festival time it was the governor’s practice to release a prisoner for the people, anyone they chose.  Now there was at that time a notorious prisoner whose name was Barabbas.  So when the crowd gathered, Pilate said to them, ‘Which do you want me to release for you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?’  For Pilate knew it was out of jealousy that they had handed him over.  Now as he was seated in the chair of judgement, his wife sent him a message, ‘Have nothing to do with that man; I have been upset all day by a dream I had about him’.  The chief priests and the elders, however, had persuaded the crowd to demand the release of Barabbas and the execution of Jesus.  So when the governor spoke and asked them, ‘Which of the two do you want me to release for you?’ they said, ‘Barabbas’.  ‘But in that case,’ Pilate said to them ‘what am I to do with Jesus who is called Christ?’ They all said, ‘Let him be crucified!’  ‘Why?’ he asked ‘What harm has he done?’ But they shouted all the louder, ‘Let him be crucified!’  Then Pilate saw that he was making no impression, that in fact a riot was imminent. So he took some water, washed his hands in front of the crowd and said, ‘I am innocent of this man’s blood. It is your concern.’  And the people, to a man, shouted back, ‘His blood be on us and on our children!’  Then he released Barabbas for them. He ordered Jesus to be first scourged and then handed over to be crucified."

At that, the veil of the Temple was torn in two from top to bottom; the earth quaked; the rocks were split;  the tombs opened and the bodies of many holy men rose from the dead,  and these, after his resurrection, came out of the tombs, entered the Holy City and appeared to a number of people.
